Anything can work if you work it when people say you don't deserve it
Then don't give in 'cuz hate may win some battles but love wins in the end

Wanna be wanna be everything I outta be to you 
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
If you got a diamond for all of your passion
A guitar with only one string I can only play one song ooh
A simple melody simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing you know what I mean
See growing up II always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I I just didn't think I was good enough
And maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
And by not being perfect youyou sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Oh oh just as sure as the stars in the sky
Not just for the meanwhile for a long long time
So I sleep through the daylight stay awake all night
Got a whole lotta texts on my phone and I don't reply
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you
If you open up your heart and just let me in
Tell me what you need girl I will never disappoint you
And if you ride with me I can show you babe
And nobody gonna know you like I know you babe
Everything I had to do I did it next to you 
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby you got used to
But I didn't accept the truth I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time I should have rationed it 
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning 
We could be starving we could be homeless we could be broke
I'll be your platinum I'll be your silver I'll be your gold
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress  don't cry  we don't need no wings to fly
I don't know if this makes sense but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place and I'll rendezvous itI'll fly you to it
Now we are on top of the world 'cause that's just how we do 
Used to tell me "Sky's the limit" now the sky's our point of view 
Ask me what's my best side I stand back and point at you
You you the one that I argue with I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
So I know we got issues baby true true true
I'll be your platinum  I'll be your silver I'll be your gold
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
Don't stress don't cry we don't need no wings to fly
Give me a time and place and I'll rendezvous and I'll fly you to it
Now we are on top of the world 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me "Sky's the limit" now the sky's our point of view
You you the one that I argue with I feel like I need a new girl to be bothering with
As long as you love you love me you love me
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I wanna play it cool but I'm losin' you
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
Luda! When I was 13 I had my first love
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She made my heart pound it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
You said "I come in peace" so I took you home
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset you lost your family in a wreck
You taught me how to dream and how to love
I'm from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed I'm the only one that survived
Yeah I'm an alien my swag is outta this world
When I die they gon' name this planet after me
We don't take love for granted it's a gift from the mother land
In your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
No I didn't think you would let me down that easy
And I didn't think it was over until you walked away
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone oh no
But I didn't think you would let me down that easy
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Need to see your face I need to look in your eyes
And for you oh I would walk a thousand miles
And for you oh I would walk a thousand miles
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
Take a bow you're on the hottest ticket now oh 
In time ink lines bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours it's mine ten little letters on a big sign

Buns out wiener but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener

Baby do it like you do whoa oh oh oh

If I had the chance if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to bewanted to be your enemy no
If I would have known it could have been you been you
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
There were days when I was just broken you know
No I won't I won't ever ever let you down 
Like a see saw lets you down  you know why
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

Drummin' the Benz kissing Mercedes living the life and acting so crazy.
Never been lazy never been shady lost a few friends the moneys still gravy.
Save some and invest some just let my money be patient.
Its a cold world that we live in diamonds all in my pendant.
They can't tell Satan whats in it and they pray for me to be finished.
Haters gonna start trippin' when you don't pay them no attention.
Feeling better than Ive ever been it must be adrenaline
101 is backed up Laurel canyon is a way to go
Venice beach you can see clear almost as pretty as you dear
And it's crazy to me I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be Could this be happening to me
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
Or should I move in close or just be still 
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Do you believe enough to die for it die for it die for it
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it Whoa
Do you believe enough to die for it to die for it

Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above
I will jump right over into cold cold water for you
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that i could fear
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
When broken hearts rise up to say "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply yeah
Out of all things in life that I could fear yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here whoa
And I fall in love with you all over again yeah
You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me "baby"
You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you "baby"
Can we be can we be be each other's company
What's your nationality I wonder if there's more of you
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She ain't got a heart or an ass just her brains
And she love to hurn the berb I mean burn the word
Stay fitted like Diddy here back tryna rock the boat
She say "I know honey bunny that's a funny thing."

Quiero quiero quiero ver cunto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
Ooh if there is a reason to call me a fool
So we fight so we fight through the hurt through the hurt
And we live and we live and we learn and we learn
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Back down to Earth back down to Earth back down to Earth back down to Earth
Back down to Earth back down to Earth back down to Earth back down to Earth
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow
Whoa so far away. And now I just need you here

J to the U to the S to the T
A newborn king to see pa rum pa pum pum.
Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pa pum pum.
To lay before the king pa rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum.
Rum pa pa pum rum pa pum pum pum pum.
Yeah I'm on the drum yeah I'm on the snare drum.

I have no gifts to bring pa rum pa pum pum.
Matter of fact let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here.
Pa rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum.
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker.
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer;
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter.
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Bieber hit me back and said "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now.
The ox and lamb kept time pa rum pa pum pum.

JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the snare.
It's crazy how some people say say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair.
'Cause they warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls.
So I think some of you need to act bold;
Give a can to a drive let's change the globe.
You can't make up your mind mind mind mind mind
Tell me where you wanna go I can take you there
We can fly across the globe baby don't be scared
Put my hand on your cheek let that fair hit you
But girl when it comes to love it isn't true that less is more
I can be on a G6 in an hour baby it's easy for real
Cause the way that you're dropping it's making me stare and
I know that you're rocking those jeans that you wear
Them curves got me going insane girl I swear ha
This is the time of year we can give it
One through ten on your list you can get it
Fa la la la la fa la la la la
Snow falling on your hair and I don't I don't
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
Fa la la la la la la fa la la la la la la...
Fa la la la la la la la la la la la la la...
One through the note your list you can get it
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware
I'm here to make you happy I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all oh my love
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out
Don't have to be scared at all  oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
But she can never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you Or were you not aware
You're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all oh my love
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
But I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
Well did you know you're an angel Who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone everytime he done wrong
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song
Than you deserve 'cause you're the girl of my dreams
Only if you give give your first dance to me
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
If you just give give your first dance to me
Girl if you see something you like then let him know
Why did you go against me I just wanna know
All the love I'm givin' don't act like you don't know
I was out there on the road life out of control
And I know that it's not fair that don't mean that I don't care
And I know I told you last time was the last time 
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline 
How could you pull the plug and leave me flatline
Shut my heart down now I don't know what Imma do now
I know I told you last time was the last time
I think I found my girl if its you then holla
I think I found my girl if its you then speak to me
And its about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just wanna say that you stay on my mind each and every day
I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
I dont want to hide the way I feel so I guess its time for me to say
Its good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
But if its something like it I want it to remain
Dont know if youre the one that takes a little time
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if its a hint of whats to come then baby can I get some more
Not trying to be too forward but I think its best for you to know
I think I found my girl if its you then speak to me
Oh baby we'll see what the future holds for us
When it's raining it's pouring how do I always end up the enemy
How do I wake up in the morning You're not right next to me
Maybe yes next time what if there's no next time
When our love has been broken we can barely even speak
One minute we're so red the next we're knocked right up our feet
Protected both our interests our trust was in a bank
Now this is out of our hands our love is here to stay
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
Get used to me touching you get used to me loving you
Oh used to me holding you used to me wowing you
Make sure that our fireworks be your Fourth of July for life
Used to me falling through just to see your face

Yo they bout to party hardy. lookin for a hottie with a nice body

Ladies if you got a man put your hands up
they say it's only just as worse as you make it
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door 
The first time when you said forever I'll be yours
Started walking your hand in my hand feelings got stronger
And whenever I leave it feels like your still with me
Sitting in my room I gotta get out of here 
what am I to do when I look up and your not there
It's going to hurt worse as long as I stay here  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it 
but if only this is love I could get over
It's going to hurt worse as long as I stay here
they say it's only just as worse as you make it  
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Girl you say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go 
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But this is personal this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you're feeling the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you're feeling the way that I the way that I
You told me to be careful with your heart your heart
And my snapback on with the rap back on uh-uh

Want you wrapped 'round my arm like a wrist watch
Yeah that turned up kind of love and it just wont stop
Trying to maintain so dont mind if I turn away 
I try to maintain so dont mind if I turn away ooh
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
I'm not afraid to tell ya that you're the one
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line it don't mean that much
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
And I really tried taking you serious baby its really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl my heart is crushed
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
You had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
When you was just a youngun youre looks but so precious
So fly it's like a blessing but you cant have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
Crying up above I'm just here to take you away
Don't worry 'bout a thing I'm just focused on you today
So hard to leave but I know I gotta go now
You sent me a picture well I sent one too
Oh babe I got your heart and I won't give it back
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense
This life's not easy I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human don't forget that I'm real
I got to learn things learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like no matter what they say
Had to be back in the crib before the streets lights
That was back when you wasn't allowed to have friends
Seen you at the club had me like hold up
What you doing' who you with what you sippin' on 
Who you doing where you being let me take you home
And if you hungry we can stop at the Waffle House
I'm on that shit it's whatever what you talking 'bout
And watch me run up in that thang like the finish line
Give her a bit a this it ain't no way she getting tired
Introduced to the molly now she's amp'd and she's wired
Get her back to the room she said Twizzy is who I desire
I said let's get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
That shit don't need even matter as long as love transpires
And after all that baby you should really know me
Right next to me baby right next to me baby
I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys yeah.
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV yeah
Run away to a hideaway we'd be living the American Dream
But I know that it won't hurt us to try oh.
Anytime you ask me why I'm smiling say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I past lovers that made you cry
But I know that it won't hurt us to try
And I know and I know sometimes it's hard to see
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely trippin I just can't do this again
Will you run away gotta wait on after love back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you're waiting for
Play by the rules and you can get what I give.
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me tell me are you gonna kiss  and tell
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem.
But I'd rather spend a little time with you yeah
And I would like to be the one to show you I am cool enough
Looking so good that I just want to telephone her
Oh she tries to fight but she knows she likes it
Oh she tries to fight it but she knows she likes it

Hoppin' out the Chevy steppin' with a mink gold chain Mr. T
In the summer in the beach with hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my huh but I bet they watching me
I'm a vegetarian all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly your bitch calling me call me your majesty
My bitch is so gorgeous I might pay her mortgage
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch she watching me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
Give you little more because I love you love you
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you above you
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Love me like you do but let me go first
Love me like you do love me like it's new
Love me like you love me like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in a benz if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in the bed baby if you're tryna snooze
Got a lot of secrets baby can you guess clues
And if you had a choice I know what you'd choose
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah.
Love me like you do do do do do do do...
For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own. Well I ain't
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
And when you told me that you hated my friends
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls
And if you think  that I'm  still holdin' on  to somethin'
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change
I heard you're looking for somebody to treat you right
'Cause them other guys don't live up to their height.
I heard you're looking for somebody to smack your heart.
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want .
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say
As I'm singin an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
So I turn around and headed to the old run down building
I watch the upper class men drive right past me
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to
If I do then I won't be gone for long
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon
Justin Bieber's Pop star Justin Bieber denied he fathered a child
There's a lot of good that comes with celebrity you know that
Alright well obviously this is what comes along with uh
And she was dragging my name through the dirt no
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
But she talking in and she needs to quit it
'Cause I never hit it so I know she's not mine
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
If you spend the night baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through
Cause I love you need you need you here to stay
And wish that I could fix it I wish things were different
What else what else if you love me girl then say it
Say what else what else if you wanna be my baby
I hit once have to have it I hit it twice it's a habit don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous the stormin' outside let's do that on the mattress
I just keep asking is it real is it real Look tell me is it real
Give you flowers now you look like you won a pageant
I can take you to the crib condo or the cabin what's up
If you make it I can make it happen I can grant it
I know that's not your intent we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
I put the writin' on the wall but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one both one of ones and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two it's forever I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I can teach you how to dougie in the white sand
Take my hand and let me lead the way lead the way let me lead the way
Take my hand and let me lead the way lead the way lead the way
'cause I am feeling one thing your lips on my lips
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven 
'Cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better 
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
No pun intended was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force when push comes to shove
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
I know you need a little while to believe again
Don't rush it girl just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no place to leave
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf right
Oh you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now right now
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
The sun don't set the same 'less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same 'less you're waking up in here with me
Oh my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away it's so empty
Oh been around the world ain't the same without you
Focus ain't the same if the picture ain't got you in it
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you I don't get it
All of the angels must be lonely now without you whoa
Oh been around the world ain't the same without you
I wish that I could give you what you deserve...
And know we won't find a love that's so true...
Swagger at the knapsack who know I could rap that
Tell me where the cash at I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits I got number one flicks and the number one kicks and number one chicks 
People in their basements say that I didn't write this 
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this 
Checks like Nike let me give you a good night kiss 
I hate it when they littering I hate to be illiterate 
I'm so much cooler you should call me Ferris Bueller.
Let's show you how we 'bout to get in hey
Yeah we got some shoes and now we looking for some girls
Now we rollin' down the mall tryin'a find a G-shock
I've been to LA New York I've done it all
You know I'm a star you know I'm a star
Hey there Justin you got a dollar I can borrow
Skin so soft hands on my face to be directed
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before
But no more if you let me inside of your world
 Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
Christmas wasn't merry 14th of February not one of them spent with you
But no more if you let me inside of your world
Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely
C'est avec toi que je veux tre plus que tout
Il faut que tu passes la porte pour que je te dlivre
You just be honest with me I know we can make this work
I wanna give it all give it all to you
I know that if we make it there's a reason
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
If I came to your crib would you open the door

If you're the only thing I ever get for christmas

Am I a sinner 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
I pray for all the souls that need a break.
Sending out a farewell to my friends for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins oh would you please
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent my spirit's at ease
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
I don't care anywhere you could pick the spot whatever

I'mma put you down I'mma put you down I'mma put you down
Put you down put you down put you down put you down down

We could go to the movies or the mall baby I don't care
And all my problems they go right through the door
We could go to the moon and through the air

Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine

Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day just laugh talk and eat
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
She don't like the flash wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame hate it when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
And throw us all away 'cause it's too much for her
She can't hide away 'cause the world knows who we are
Don't wanna share with no one else want me to herself
She said if I loved her I'd give it up won't think twice
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away 'cause it's too much for her
She don't wanna live this life damn it's my life

All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

(Oh yeah let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I could tell I could tell I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
I'm all day with it man A.M to the P.M
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
Call up one drink and let's let's call up one uh

Well never do I ever do I want this thing to make me
'Cause the fame and the money and the girls will drive you crazy
You know I got you until the whole world ends
And I'm a be the one to make you smile for a minute
Put your head down let it down for a minute.
